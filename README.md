# 🔗 Merge Sort on Linked List
## 📌 Overview

This project implements Merge Sort on a Singly Linked List.
Merge Sort is well-suited for linked lists because it does not require random access and works efficiently using pointer manipulation.

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer)

Steps:

Find the middle of the linked list using slow–fast pointer technique

Split the list into two halves

Recursively sort both halves

Merge the sorted halves into a single sorted list

## 🧠 Why Merge Sort for Linked List?

No extra array needed

Efficient pointer-based merging

Guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity

Stable sorting algorithm

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis
Type	Complexity
Time	O(n log n)
Space	O(log n) (recursion stack)
🧪 Example

Input:
4 → 2 → 1 → 3

Output:
1 → 2 → 3 → 4

## 🛠 Key Concepts Used

Linked List traversal

Slow & Fast pointer technique

Recursion

Divide and Conquer strategy


## 🚀 How to Run

Compile the program

Provide linked list input in Main.java

Run and observe the sorted output

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

Understand merge sort at pointer level

Strengthen linked list recursion concepts

Improve DSA problem-solving skills
